# Quotes-Guessing-Game
This project uses Web Scrapping, Networking libraries such as "bs4" and "requests" which helps to extract large information from the website and allowing to send http requests in extremely easy way from "#http://quotes.toscrape.com". 

It is basically designed for users to guess correct author's name for given quotes within 4 guesses. Hints are also provided to the user for making it a user friendly game.

As this libraires are not predefined in python library so you need to install it using "pip".

For bs4 :- pip install bs4

Similarly, for requests:- pip install requests

***Install these libraries before running the game***
